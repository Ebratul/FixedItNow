```

The AI service never touches the database and is never called by browsers. It only extracts intent and phrases answers from curated knowledge; the API re-reads workers from PostgreSQL before showing anything.

### Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Web | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| API | NestJS 12, Prisma 7, Zod validation, Helmet, rate limiting |
| Auth | Better Auth (server-side sessions in PostgreSQL, Google OAuth, email OTP) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (exclusion constraints prevent double-booking; append-only audit tables) |
| AI | FastAPI (Python 3.12), optional OpenRouter model, optional Pinecone for the knowledge base |
| Payments | bKash, SSLCOMMERZ |
| Testing | Vitest, pytest, real-Chrome end-to-end checks with axe accessibility audits |

### User roles

| Role | Can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Visitor** | Browse services, professionals and public profiles |
| **Customer** | Search, favourite, book, chat, pay, review, report content |
| **Worker** | Build a profile, set availability, send quotes, manage bookings (visible only after admin approval) |
| **Admin** | Approve workers, moderate content, manage payments, support and the AI knowledge base, with granular permissions |

One account can be both a customer and a worker. Admin rights can only be granted from the server with `npm run admin:grant`, never through the API.

### Repository layout

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`frontend/`](frontend) | Next.js web application: public site, dashboards, assistant, admin UI |
| [`backend/`](backend) | Main API: NestJS 12, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL, Better Auth |
| [`rag_agent/`](rag_agent) | AI assistant service: FastAPI, intent extraction, curated-knowledge retrieval, safe search tool |
| [`docs/`](docs) | SRS, architecture, security, runbook, audit and per-feature design notes |
| [`.github/`](.github) | CI workflow |

## 🚀 Getting started

**Requirements:** Node 24, PostgreSQL 16+ (Docker optional), Python 3.12+ (only for the AI service).

```bash
# 1. Database + backend
cd backend
docker compose up -d db              # or use your own PostgreSQL
cp .env.example .env                 # set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32)
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed
npm run start:dev                    # http://localhost:4000

# 2. Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev                          # http://localhost:3000

# 3. AI assistant (optional, new terminal)
cd rag_agent
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env                 # set the service tokens; OPENROUTER_* is optional
set -a; . ./.env; set +a; .venv/bin/python -m app
```

In development the email verification code and password-reset links are printed in the backend terminal. All environment variables and Google OAuth setup are in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). Without OpenRouter credentials the AI service runs in a rule-based "simple mode".

To try the public demo: `npm run demo:seed` (in `backend`), then switch the options on in Admin → Platform settings → Demo Access Settings ([docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md)). Demo access is off by default.

## ✅ Checks

| Where | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm test` |
| `backend/` | `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm test` · `npm run test:e2e` (needs a disposable `*_test` database) |
| `rag_agent/` | `pytest` · `ruff check .` · `mypy` · `python -m evals.run_eval` |

CI runs these in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## 🔒 Security highlights

- Passwords hashed with scrypt; sessions are `HttpOnly` cookies backed by the database, so revoking one takes effect immediately.
- Default-deny authentication guard, roles read from the database on every request, and strict schemas that reject unexpected fields (IDOR protection).
- Identical responses for known and unknown emails (no account enumeration), Google sign-in with state and PKCE, origin checks on unsafe requests.
- Server-side Zod validation everywhere, Helmet headers, rate limiting, and a tamper-evident audit log.

Full details: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## 📍 Project status

The project is **ready for staging, not for production** (see [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md)).

**Built and tested:** public site, accounts and onboarding, discovery, bookings, payments, chat and in-app notifications, reviews, community and moderation, AI assistant, admin panel, container images and a CI workflow.

**Not verified against the real services** (no credentials were available; everything is tested against mocks or sandboxes):

- bKash and SSLCOMMERZ payments (bKash was only exercised in its sandbox by hand)
- Google sign-in and real SMTP email delivery
- OpenRouter / a real language model for the AI assistant

**Not built yet:** worker payouts, email/SMS notifications (notifications are in-app only), Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (no approved legal text exists, so none is invented).

## 🚢 Deployment

The web app is live at **https://fixeditnowwithragagent-web.vercel.app**. The three services are deployable as separate projects (for example on Vercel) or as containers. Dockerfiles, a disposable staging stack and a runbook for deployment, backup/restore, rollback and incident handling are provided: [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) and [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). Behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` so rate limiting sees real client IPs ([docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)).
