# FixedItNow --- Final SRS & Full Implementation Architecture

**Document type:** Software Requirements Specification (SRS) + Technical
Architecture + Implementation Plan\
**Product:** FixedItNow\
**Primary market:** Bangladesh\
**Status:** Implementation baseline; validate provider-specific details
and legal/payment requirements before production launch\
**Last updated:** 24 October 2026

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Executive Summary

FixedItNow is a Bangladesh-focused service marketplace that connects
customers with local service workers. Customers can discover workers,
compare profiles and prices, request or book services, communicate in a
booking-linked conversation, pay through supported payment providers,
review completed work, and participate in a community. Workers can
create a service profile, list skills and prices, manage availability
and bookings, communicate with customers, and view their earnings.
Administrators manage platform operations, verification, moderation,
disputes, service categories, and audit trails.

The product includes an AI-assisted worker-discovery experience. The AI
layer can understand natural-language requests, retrieve platform help
and policy content, and invoke a restricted set of tools to search the
live marketplace. Live prices, ratings, and availability must come from
authoritative database queries rather than model-generated guesses.

The system is designed for incremental delivery, strong privacy
controls, safe payment handling, role-based access, and replaceable
providers. A free-tier-first deployment strategy is preferred, but
production readiness depends on provider limits, uptime, persistent
storage, background-job support, domain/email setup, and
payment-provider approval.

### 1.1 Product goals

1.  Make it easy for customers in Bangladesh to find and book
    trustworthy local service workers.
2.  Give workers a clear way to publish services, manage requests, and
    build reputation.
3.  Support a single account that can hold both Customer and Worker
    capabilities.
4.  Keep Admin access separate and tightly controlled.
5.  Support booking-based messaging, notifications, reviews, and dispute
    handling.
6.  Support bKash and SSLCOMMERZ through server-verified payment
    workflows.
7.  Add a safe AI assistant for discovery and platform guidance.
8.  Provide a moderated community for discussion and feature proposals.
9.  Protect identity documents, private messages, payment records, and
    account sessions.
10. Deliver in testable phases, without pretending that unconfigured
    integrations work.

### 1.2 Non-goals for the initial release

-   No unrestricted AI access to the database, shell, deployment
    credentials, or production code.
-   No automatic production deployment or service-category activation
    based on community votes or AI recommendations.
-   No claim that identity documents are government-verified unless an
    approved verification process actually exists.
-   No claim of real payment success based only on a browser redirect.
-   No guaranteed zero-cost hosting or payment processing; free tiers
    and transaction fees are provider-dependent.
-   No public exposure of a worker's NID image or other private
    verification documents.
-   No arbitrary public access to private booking conversations.

                                                  records
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dual-role requirement:** One user account may have both Customer and
Worker capabilities. Customer and Worker are capabilities, not mutually
exclusive account types. Admin is a privileged role and must not be
granted through public self-registration.

### 2.2 Role and permission rules

-   Enforce authorization on the server for every protected operation;
    hiding a button is not authorization.
-   Users can access only their own private profile fields, bookings,
    messages, payment history, and uploaded documents unless a
    documented role permission permits otherwise.
-   Workers may access customer details only when necessary for a
    booking and only within the defined privacy policy.
-   Admin access must use explicit RBAC permissions, strong
    authentication, and audit logging.
-   Sensitive admin actions should require a reason and be recorded in
    an append-only audit trail.
-   A worker verification status does not imply Google-account
    verification, and Google OAuth does not imply worker identity
    verification.
-   Admin actions must not silently alter historical payment or booking
    records.

    must trigger an external side effect.
-   Make background jobs retry-safe and define maximum
    attempts/dead-letter handling.
-   Provide health/readiness endpoints without disclosing secrets.
-   Use database migrations committed to source control; never rely on
    undocumented manual schema changes.
-   Use explicit time zones and store timestamps consistently in UTC;
    render local time appropriately.
-   Keep booking and payment state transitions in domain services, not
    scattered across UI components.

### 5.3 Performance and accessibility

-   Target mobile-first responsive design and usable keyboard
    navigation.
-   Avoid unbounded database queries and large unpaginated lists.
-   Optimize public images and use appropriate caching.
-   Set timeouts for external providers and provide graceful failure
    states.
-   Use accessible contrast, visible focus, labels, and semantic
    controls.
-   Use skeletons only while loading; provide meaningful empty and error
    states.
-   Establish measurable performance budgets during implementation
    rather than claiming untested scores.

### 5.4 Maintainability and observability

-   Use TypeScript strict mode where feasible.
-   Keep business logic out of presentation components.
-   Use shared validation schemas where appropriate.
-   Maintain structured, privacy-safe logs and correlation/request IDs.
-   Add metrics for errors, queue backlog, provider failures, payment
    reconciliation, and AI cost.
-   Document architecture decisions and provider setup.
-   Keep integrations behind interfaces/adapters to permit provider
    changes.

The stack below is a recommended implementation baseline. Preserve an
existing working stack when repository inspection shows a materially
different but sound architecture; document the decision instead of
blindly rewriting the project.

**Trust boundary:** The browser is untrusted. The AI service is a
separate service with narrowly scoped access. Payment callbacks are
untrusted until verified. Public media and private verification
documents use separate access rules.

## 7. Repository Structure

Adapt names to the existing repository rather than duplicating
applications unnecessarily.

``` text
first-eat-now/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                       # Next.js UI

│   ├── config/                    # Shared lint/TypeScript config if useful

```

If the current repository uses `frontend/`, `backend/`, and
`rag_agent/`, retain those directories if they already work. Do not
rename or replace project structure solely to match this illustration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Data Model and Prisma Baseline

The schema below is a conceptual baseline, not a substitute for
reviewing the repository's current schema and generating migrations
carefully. Field types, enums, relations, indexes, and deletion policies
should be validated against the chosen Prisma/PostgreSQL versions. Add
migrations incrementally; do not reset a database containing important
data.

### 8.1 Core entities

-   `User`: identity, email, password hash where applicable, account
    status.
-   `OAuthAccount`: provider and provider account mapping.
-   `Session` or `RefreshToken`: revocable authenticated sessions,
    depending on auth design.
-   `WorkerProfile`: public worker information and verification status.
-   `WorkerDocument`: private identity/verification document metadata
    and review outcome.
-   `ServiceCategory`: category hierarchy and active state.
-   `WorkerSkill`: worker-to-category/skill mapping.
-   `WorkerPricing`: fixed-price or quote-required pricing.
-   `WorkerAvailability`: recurring or dated availability windows.
-   `Favorite`: customer-worker favorites.
-   `Booking`: request, quote, schedule, price snapshot, and status.
-   `BookingStatusHistory`: append-only record of status changes.
-   `Dispute`: booking-related dispute and resolution.
-   `Payment`: payment attempt and current provider state.
-   `PaymentEvent`: deduplicated provider callback/event record.
-   `PaymentLedgerEntry`: append-only financial ledger entries.
-   `Review`: booking-linked customer review.
-   `Conversation`, `ConversationMember`, `Message`: private
    booking-linked communication.
-   `MediaAsset`: metadata and storage key for uploaded media, with
    visibility/access policy.
-   `Notification`: recipient-specific notification state.
-   `CommunityPost`, `PostComment`, `PostReaction`, `ContentReport`:
    community and moderation.
-   `FeatureProposal`, `FeatureVote`: feature governance.
-   `AuditLog`: privileged/security-sensitive actions.
-   `OutboxEvent` / job record: durable dispatch of external side
    effects where needed.

### 8.2 Prisma schema starter

This is a compact schema outline to guide implementation. Claude Code
must compare it with the repository and expand it into a complete,
validated schema before migrations are applied. Do not paste it over an
existing production schema without reconciliation.

``` prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

  QUOTE_REQUIRED
}

enum BookingStatus {
  REQUESTED
  QUOTED
  ACCEPTED
  CONFIRMED
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETION_PENDING
  COMPLETED
  REJECTED
  CANCELLED
  EXPIRED

}

enum PaymentStatus {

**Schema implementation notes:**

1.  This starter schema intentionally leaves some fields generic.
    Replace generic strings with enums where useful, add missing reverse
    relations required by Prisma validation, and run `prisma validate`
    before creating migrations.
2.  Decide whether `roles` should be a PostgreSQL enum array or a
    normalized role/capability join table. If using arrays, verify the
    exact Prisma support and authorization strategy. A normalized
    `UserRole` table may be preferable for evolving permissions.
3.  `PaymentEvent.providerEventId` uniqueness may need a composite key
    including provider, depending on provider semantics. Ensure nullable
    uniqueness behaves as intended in PostgreSQL.
4.  Avoid storing raw provider callback payloads. Persist only redacted,
    minimized fields needed for verification/reconciliation.
5.  Booking-overlap protection may require a PostgreSQL exclusion
    constraint or carefully scoped transaction/locking beyond a simple
    Prisma model.
6.  Consider a separate `Session` model if the selected authentication
    library requires it.
7.  Add foreign keys, delete policies, retention handling, and indexes
    based on real query patterns.
8.  Use decimal-safe money handling; never use JavaScript floating-point
    arithmetic for authoritative financial totals.
9.  Keep identity document content outside normal user profile rows and
    store only private storage keys/metadata in the database.
10. Generate and review migrations; never run destructive schema resets
    against a production database.

## 9. API Design

### 9.1 General conventions

-   Base path: `/api/v1`.
-   JSON request/response bodies unless an upload endpoint explicitly
    uses multipart form data.
-   Use consistent response envelopes where useful.
-   Validate all inputs at the API boundary.
-   Require authentication and authorization for protected endpoints.
-   Use pagination for list endpoints (`limit`, `cursor` or `page`);
    enforce a server-side maximum.
-   Use ISO-8601 timestamps and document timezone behavior.
-   Use idempotency keys for payment creation and other retry-sensitive
    mutations.
-   Version breaking changes and keep API documentation synchronized
    with code.

Suggested success response:

``` json
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "request-id"
  }
}
```

Suggested error response:

``` json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Please check the submitted fields.",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "requestedStartAt",
        "issue": "Invalid date"
      }
    ],
    "requestId": "request-id"
  }
}
```

Do not expose stack traces, SQL errors, provider secrets, internal file
paths, or private record details in production error responses.

### 9.2 Authentication endpoints

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method            Endpoint                      Access                   Purpose
  ----------------- ----------------------------- ------------------------ ----------------------

  POST              `/auth/roles/worker`          Customer/authenticated   Enable Worker
                                                                           capability and create
                                                                           onboarding draft
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OAuth callback routes depend on the selected authentication
library/provider. Configure the exact callback URI in the provider
console; do not invent or hard-code production credentials.

### 9.3 Public discovery endpoints

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method            Endpoint                        Access            Purpose
  ----------------- ------------------------------- ----------------- ------------------

  GET               `/workers/:idOrSlug/reviews`    Public            Eligible public
                                                                      reviews

  GET               `/workers/:idOrSlug/services`   Public            Public

Example query:

``` text
GET /api/v1/workers?category=plumbing&area=Sylhet&minRating=4&minPrice=300&maxPrice=2000&sort=rating&limit=20
```

All filters must be validated and applied server-side. Do not trust
client-supplied aggregate ratings or worker verification values.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefer explicit domain actions over a generic endpoint that accepts any
status value.

### 9.6 Payment endpoints

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method            Endpoint                          Access                   Purpose

  POST              `/admin/payments/:id/reconcile`   Authorized Admin         Trigger
                                                                               authorized
                                                                               reconciliation
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Payment creation must calculate the amount from the authoritative
booking snapshot, persist a payment attempt, and then call the provider.
Provider callbacks must be idempotent and verified. A browser-return URL
is for user experience only and cannot independently finalize payment
state.

### 9.7 Messaging and notifications endpoints

                                                                      notifications
                                                                      read
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.8 Reviews, community, and feature requests

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.9 Admin endpoints

Examples (must be protected by specific server-side permissions):

-   `GET /admin/overview`
-   `GET /admin/verifications`
-   `POST /admin/verifications/:documentId/decision`
-   `GET /admin/disputes`
-   `POST /admin/disputes/:id/decision`
-   `GET /admin/reports`
-   `POST /admin/reports/:id/decision`
-   `POST /admin/categories`
-   `PATCH /admin/categories/:id`
-   `POST /admin/users/:id/suspend`
-   `POST /admin/users/:id/restore`
-   `GET /admin/audit-logs`
-   `GET /admin/payments/reconciliation`

Admin route names may be refined during implementation, but the
authorization model and audit requirements must remain.

### 9.10 AI endpoints

-   `POST /ai/chat`: authenticated assistant request with limits.
-   `POST /ai/worker-search`: structured natural-language search mapped
    to allowlisted filters/tools.
-   `GET /ai/health`: service health without secrets.
-   Optional admin-only knowledge-base ingestion endpoints must be
    authenticated and must not be publicly exposed.

AI responses should contain a user-facing answer and, where appropriate,
structured references to real workers or help articles. The API must
validate any worker IDs returned by tools before sending them to the
browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep a committed `.env.example` with placeholders only. Never commit
`.env`, production secrets, private keys, provider tokens, or actual
database credentials.

### 10.4 Environment rules

-   Validate required variables at service startup and fail with a clear
    message that does not reveal secret values.
-   Separate development, test, staging, and production credentials.
-   Use the provider's exact current callback and sandbox configuration.
-   Do not put private server secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.
-   A `.env.example` documents names only; it does not mean a provider
    is configured.
-   `APP_API_SERVICE_TOKEN` must be narrowly scoped, rotated, and never
    returned to the browser.
-   Disable sensitive tracing by default until redaction and access
    controls are verified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. UI/UX and Design System Requirements

### 11.1 Visual direction

Design FixedItNow as a polished, trustworthy, modern Bangladesh
service marketplace. The UI should feel clear, welcoming, premium, and
practical rather than overly decorative.

Suggested visual language: - White and light neutral surfaces with deep
navy/blue for trust and hierarchy. - Teal/green accents for positive
actions and confirmed states. - Consistent spacing, restrained shadows,
subtle borders, rounded cards, and clear typography. - Support Bangla
and English text without clipping or awkward line wrapping. - Use real
product data and genuine empty states rather than decorative fake
metrics. - Avoid excessive gradients, animation, glassmorphism, or huge
hero sections that bury the main task.

### 11.2 Core layout

-   Public pages: responsive header, clear service search, category
    discovery, worker cards, how-it-works, trust/safety content, footer.
-   Customer area: compact dashboard navigation, booking overview,
    favorites, messages, notifications, profile/settings.
-   Worker area: profile completion, verification status, incoming
    requests, availability, services/pricing, reviews, earnings.
-   Admin area: operational navigation, queue counts, searchable tables,
    safe confirmation dialogs, audit history.
-   Mobile: accessible bottom navigation or compact menu where
    appropriate; avoid horizontal overflow.

### 11.3 Required component states

For every async screen, implement: - Initial loading/skeleton state. -
Empty state with a meaningful next action. - Error state with safe
message and retry. - Form validation state. - Disabled/loading button
state. - Success feedback. - Permission-denied state where applicable. -
Responsive and keyboard-focus states.

### 11.4 UI implementation rules

-   Reuse shared components and design tokens.
-   Avoid giant single-file pages and duplicated styling.
-   Use semantic forms and labels; don't rely only on placeholder text.
-   Make destructive actions explicit and confirm them.
-   Do not expose private information in client-side serialized objects.
-   Do not add UI controls that have no implemented action.
-   If a feature is not implemented, label it clearly as unavailable/not
    configured rather than pretending it works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Background Jobs, Notifications, and Reliability

Use a durable queue/outbox pattern where the hosting environment
supports it. If a free host does not support persistent workers,
document a safe alternative and its limitations.

Candidate jobs: - Email verification and password reset delivery. -
Booking status notifications. - Payment callback retry/reconciliation. -
Voice transcription. - Review sentiment analysis. - AI knowledge-base
ingestion. - Scheduled expiry of pending bookings/verification tokens. -
Cleanup of expired temporary uploads according to retention policy.

Job requirements: 1. Jobs must be idempotent or have deduplication keys.
2. Retry only transient failures, with backoff and maximum attempts. 3.
Persist failure metadata without secrets or unnecessary PII. 4. Ensure
duplicate delivery does not create duplicate payments, votes, reviews,
or messages. 5. Provide a way to inspect failed jobs and safely retry
authorized operations. 6. Never rely on an in-memory queue for a
production workflow that must survive process restarts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Testing Strategy and Acceptance Criteria

### 13.1 Test layers

-   Unit tests: validation, pricing calculations, booking transitions,
    permissions, payment state machine.
-   Integration tests: API + test database, transactions, uniqueness
    constraints, auth, access control.
-   Provider tests: sandbox payment verification and callback
    idempotency using provider documentation/test credentials.
-   UI tests: key user journeys, validation, responsive layout,
    accessibility basics.
-   End-to-end tests: register/login, dual role, worker onboarding,
    search, booking, quote, sandbox payment, messaging, review, admin
    verification.
-   Security tests: unauthorized access, IDOR, role escalation, rate
    limiting, upload validation, prompt injection, secret leakage.
-   Migration tests: apply migrations to a clean test database and
    verify upgrade path from supported prior schema.
-   Build checks: lint, type-check, unit/integration tests, production
    build.

### 13.2 Minimum acceptance criteria

**Authentication** - A user cannot access protected data without a valid
session. - A customer cannot access another customer's bookings or
conversations. - A public user cannot become Admin by changing a request
body. - OTPs expire and cannot be reused beyond policy.

**Worker verification** - NID documents are not reachable through public
URLs. - Only authorized reviewers can access document content. -
Decisions record reviewer, time, and reason.

**Bookings** - Invalid transitions are rejected. - Concurrent
overlapping booking attempts cannot both reserve the same worker/time
when policy disallows it. - Price and booking ownership are checked on
the server. - Status history is recorded.

**Payments** - Browser redirects alone do not mark payments
successful. - Invalid/unverified callbacks are rejected. - Duplicate
callbacks do not create duplicate ledger entries or payouts. -
Reconciliation-required cases are visible to authorized operators.

**Chat and media** - A non-member cannot read or send conversation
messages. - Upload type/size and ownership are validated. - Private
media requires authorized access.

**AI** - Worker search uses real database-backed tool results. - Prompt
injection cannot grant tools or permissions. - AI cannot claim that a
booking/payment changed unless a verified application operation confirms
it. - Logs/traces redact sensitive data.

**Community/admin** - Votes are unique per user/proposal. - Reaching a
vote threshold never deploys code or activates categories
automatically. - Admin actions create audit records.

**Release** - `lint`, type-check, tests, and production build pass. -
Required environment variables are documented and validated. -
Deployment, rollback, backup, and incident procedures are documented. -
Any unconfigured provider is marked as a release blocker, not a
completed integration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 14. Deployment Architecture and Free-Tier-First Plan

### 14.1 Logical deployment topology

-   Web: managed Next.js hosting or a compatible Node host.
-   API: Node/NestJS hosting with health checks.
-   Database: managed PostgreSQL with backups and migration support.
-   Cache/queue: managed Redis-compatible service if needed.
-   AI: separate Python/FastAPI service; scale or disable independently.
-   Files: private object storage for verification documents and
    sensitive uploads; public media storage only for intentionally
    public assets.
-   Domain and email: configure DNS, sender verification, and callback
    URLs.
-   Payment: sandbox first, then provider-approved production
    credentials and verified callbacks.

Specific free tiers, quotas, sleep behavior, persistent-volume support,
queue limits, and commercial-use conditions change frequently. Verify
them immediately before choosing a provider. Do not assume a free tier
supports persistent WebSockets, scheduled jobs, private object storage,
or production-grade backups.

### 14.2 Deployment checklist

1.  Create separate development/staging/production environments.
2.  Set secrets through the host's secret manager/environment
    configuration.
3.  Provision PostgreSQL and Redis only if required by the chosen
    design.
4.  Apply reviewed migrations; do not use destructive reset commands in
    production.
5.  Configure CORS, trusted origins, cookie settings, TLS, and public
    URLs.
6.  Configure email sender and verify delivery.
7.  Configure Google OAuth callback URL if Google login is enabled.
8.  Configure private/public storage policies and verify unauthorized
    access fails.
9.  Test payment sandbox callbacks and duplicate callback behavior.
10. Configure monitoring, logs, backup/restore, and incident contacts.
11. Run smoke tests after deployment.
12. Verify rollback steps before announcing launch.

### 14.3 Release gates

Do not declare production-ready until: - Critical tests pass. - Auth,
authorization, and private-file checks pass. - Payment provider
integration is verified in sandbox and production approval is obtained
if real payments are enabled. - Database backups and restoration are
tested. - Required environment variables are configured. - The
production domain and callback URLs are correct. - Known limitations are
documented. - No critical secrets or private data appear in logs,
traces, repository history, or public files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 15. Implementation Roadmap: Phase 0--11

Claude Code should execute one phase at a time. It must inspect the
repository first, produce a plan, implement a bounded phase, run tests,
report exact results, and stop before the next phase if there are
unresolved failures or risky migrations.

### Phase 0 --- Repository audit and implementation plan

Tasks: - Inspect current files, branches, package managers, frameworks,
schema, tests, environment templates, and deployment configuration. -
Identify existing functionality and incomplete areas. - Run current
lint/type-check/test/build commands where available. - Create/update
`docs/SRS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`,
`docs/SECURITY.md`, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. - Write an implementation
gap matrix: existing / incomplete / missing / risky. - Propose a
dependency-aware phase plan. - Do not rewrite or delete working code.

Exit criteria: - A grounded architecture report exists. - Risks and
migration needs are documented. - Baseline tests and failures are
recorded.

### Phase 1 --- Foundation and design system

Tasks: - Establish UI tokens, typography, spacing, buttons, forms,
cards, dialogs, tables, alerts, skeletons, and toasts. - Implement
responsive app shell and public navigation. - Ensure accessibility and
Bangla/English rendering. - Set lint, type-check, formatting, and test
scripts. - Build reusable layout primitives.

Exit criteria: - Public shell renders on mobile and desktop. - Shared
components have meaningful states. - CI/build passes.

### Phase 2 --- Authentication and dual-role account

Tasks: - Implement registration, verification, login, logout, session
lifecycle, password reset, and optional Google OAuth. - Secure
cookie/session strategy and rate limits. - Implement Customer + Worker
capability model. - Keep Admin assignment privileged. - Add integration
tests for authorization and account enumeration risks.

Exit criteria: - Authentication journeys pass. - Cross-user access and
role escalation tests fail safely. - Provider-dependent features are
clearly marked if credentials are absent.

### Phase 3 --- Worker onboarding, documents, categories, discovery

Tasks: - Worker profile and onboarding wizard. - Private document upload
and verification queue. - Category management. - Worker listing/profile
pages and database-backed filters. - Favorites. - Pagination, sorting,
empty/error states.

Exit criteria: - Search is real, paginated, and validated. - NID
documents are private. - Worker verification status is accurate.

### Phase 4 --- Booking, quotes, availability, disputes

Tasks: - Booking creation, quotes, acceptance/rejection, cancellation,
rescheduling, completion. - Booking state machine and status history. -
Availability checks and concurrent booking protection. - Dispute
creation and admin review. - Customer and Worker dashboards.

Exit criteria: - Invalid transitions are rejected. - Ownership checks
cover all booking operations. - Concurrency tests cover overlapping
booking attempts.

### Phase 5 --- Payments

Tasks: - Provider adapters for bKash and SSLCOMMERZ. - Server-side
amount calculation. - Sandbox checkout/callback/verification. -
Idempotency and append-only payment event/ledger. - Reconciliation and
refund-state workflows.

Exit criteria: - Duplicate/invalid callbacks are handled safely. -
Browser redirects do not independently finalize payment. - Production
payment status is explicitly blocked until provider
approval/configuration.

### Phase 6 --- Messaging, media, and notifications

Tasks: - Booking-linked conversations. - Private messages and media
uploads. - Realtime transport or documented fallback. - Notifications
and delivery outbox/jobs. - Optional voice-message transcription behind
a provider adapter.

Exit criteria: - Conversation membership checks pass. - Upload security
tests pass. - Notification retries are safe.

### Phase 7 --- AI assistant and RAG

Tasks: - FastAPI service and health endpoint. - OpenRouter provider
adapter and configurable model. - RAG for approved
FAQs/policies/category content. - Allowlisted worker-search tools backed
by the API. - Input/output schema validation, limits, redaction,
prompt-injection tests. - Optional LangSmith tracing only after
redaction is tested.

Exit criteria: - Live facts are retrieved, not hallucinated. - No
arbitrary SQL/shell/admin/payment mutation tools exist. - Provider
failures degrade gracefully.

### Phase 8 --- Reviews, community, sentiment, feature proposals

Tasks: - Eligible booking reviews and one-review uniqueness. - Community
posts, comments, reactions, reports. - Feature proposals and one vote
per user. - Admin moderation queue. - Optional sentiment insights with
clear caveats.

Exit criteria: - Review eligibility and vote uniqueness are enforced. -
User content cannot trigger privileged AI actions. - Vote thresholds
only create admin review work.

### Phase 9 --- Admin dashboard and operations

Tasks: - Verification, categories, users, reports, disputes, payment
reconciliation, and audit views. - Permission-specific admin actions. -
Searchable/paginated tables and safe confirmation dialogs. -
Privacy-safe operational metrics.

Exit criteria: - Every sensitive action is authorized and audited. -
Sensitive documents and payment secrets are not exposed.

### Phase 10 --- Reliability and security hardening

Tasks: - Complete unit/integration/E2E test coverage for critical
paths. - Rate limits, secure headers, CORS, CSRF as applicable, file
validation, IDOR checks. - Queue retries/outbox, timeouts, health
checks, backup/restore tests. - Dependency/secret scans and privacy-safe
logs. - Load/performance checks appropriate to the target release.

Exit criteria: - Critical security tests pass. - No known
critical/high-severity release blockers remain unaddressed. - Migrations
and rollback steps are reviewed.

### Phase 11 --- Deployment, smoke tests, and release

Tasks: - Configure production secrets, domain, email, OAuth, storage,
database, AI, and payment adapters. - Apply reviewed migrations. - Run
smoke tests and end-to-end critical flows. - Verify logs, metrics,
backups, and rollback. - Publish user-facing limitations and support
procedures.

Exit criteria: - Release checklist is signed off. - No feature is
described as live unless it has been tested in the deployed
environment. - Provider-dependent blockers are documented clearly.

## 16. Claude Code Operating Instructions

Use these instructions as the project-wide guardrails for Claude Code.
Give it one phase prompt at a time, then review the result before
proceeding.

``` text
You are the senior engineer responsible for implementing FixedItNow from the
existing repository.

MANDATORY RULES
1. Inspect the repository before editing. Never assume the stack, directory names,
   current branch, schema, or deployment state.
2. Preserve working features. Do not replace the project wholesale or delete
   files/configuration without explaining why and getting approval.
3. Follow docs/SRS.md and the agreed architecture. If the repository conflicts
   with this document, explain the conflict and propose the smallest safe change.
4. Work on only the requested phase. Do not silently implement future phases.
5. Before editing, list the files/areas to change and the acceptance criteria.
6. Use small, reviewable changes. Keep business logic out of UI components.
7. Validate all inputs server-side and enforce authorization for every protected
   operation. Client-side hiding is not security.
8. Never hard-code secrets or commit .env files. Update .env.example with names
   and placeholders only.
9. Never fake successful payments, email delivery, OAuth, uploads, AI results,
   or production deployment.
10. Never run destructive database commands, production migrations, deployments,
    pushes, merges, or irreversible actions unless explicitly authorized.
11. For schema changes, inspect current data/schema, create a migration, explain
    data impact, and run safe validation. Do not use db push/reset as a shortcut
    for production.
12. Use real persisted data for implemented features. If an integration is not
    configured, provide a clear disabled/unavailable state and document the setup.
13. Add/update tests for each changed behavior, especially authorization, booking
    transitions, payment idempotency, file access, and AI tool permissions.
14. Run the relevant lint, type-check, tests, and build. Report commands and
    actual pass/fail results; never claim tests passed if they were not run.
15. End each phase with: summary, files changed, migrations, env variables,
    commands run, test results, known limitations, security considerations,
    and exact next step. Stop if a critical check fails.
```

### 16.1 Phase prompt template

``` text
Implement Phase [NUMBER] — [PHASE NAME] from docs/SRS.md.

First inspect the current repository and relevant documentation. Do not assume
files or functionality exist. Report:
1. Current state relevant to this phase.
2. Acceptance criteria and implementation plan.
3. Files/modules likely to change.
4. Risks, migrations, and required environment variables.

Then implement only this phase using small, reviewable changes. Preserve existing
working behavior. Add or update tests. Run the relevant lint, type-check, tests,
and build commands that are actually available. Do not perform destructive
database operations, deploy, push, or merge.

At the end, report exact files changed, commands executed, actual test results,
migration status, configuration still needed, known limitations, and unresolved
risks. If any critical check fails, fix it before declaring the phase complete.
```

### 16.2 Mandatory verification prompt after each phase

``` text
Audit the implementation from the previous phase against docs/SRS.md.

Do not add new features. Inspect the diff and look for:
- broken or duplicated architecture,
- unimplemented UI controls,
- fake/mock data presented as live data,
- missing server-side validation or authorization,
- IDOR and cross-user data exposure,
- secret or private-data leakage,
- race conditions and missing transactions,
- missing tests or tests that do not assert real behavior,
- environment/documentation gaps,
- responsive/accessibility regressions.

Run the relevant checks. Fix only issues introduced by or blocking this phase.
Report every check with its actual result. Do not say PASS unless the command or
test was actually executed and passed.
```

## 18. Open Decisions and Release Blockers

The following require a deliberate choice or provider confirmation
during implementation:

1.  **Authentication library:** Select based on the current repository;
    document session/cookie and OAuth callback behavior.
2.  **Email provider:** Verify sender/domain requirements and free-tier
    limits.
3.  **File storage:** Confirm private object access, upload size limits,
    retention, and cost. Cloudinary may be used for appropriate public
    media, not automatically for private NID files.
4.  **Realtime messaging:** Confirm host support for WebSockets;
    otherwise use a documented compatible provider or polling fallback.
5.  **Voice transcription:** Select a provider only if cost, privacy,
    and language support meet requirements.
6.  **Payment production approval:** bKash/SSLCOMMERZ merchant
    onboarding, credentials, callback URLs, fees, and production
    verification are external dependencies.
7.  **Worker verification policy:** Define acceptable documents,
    authorized reviewers, retention period, deletion process, and
    truthful badge wording.
8.  **Cancellation/refund policy:** Define time windows, fees, and who
    can approve refunds before enabling real payments.
9.  **Dispute policy:** Define evidence, review process, timelines, and
    escalation.
10. **Location provider:** Verify usage limits and terms for
    tiles/geocoding.
11. **Deployment providers:** Verify current free-tier quotas, sleeping
    behavior, backups, background worker support, and data location.
12. **Legal/privacy review:** Review applicable Bangladesh requirements
    and provider terms before production launch.

Do not silently invent a policy for a high-impact open decision. Add a
documented default for development and flag the production decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 19. Definition of Done

A feature is done only when all relevant conditions are met:

-   Its behavior matches an explicit requirement.
-   UI has loading, empty, error, success, and permission states as
    applicable.
-   Server-side validation and authorization are implemented.
-   Data is persisted correctly and protected by appropriate
    constraints.
-   Tests cover happy path and important negative/security paths.
-   Logs and errors do not expose secrets or unnecessary personal data.
-   Documentation and environment examples are updated.
-   Relevant lint/type-check/tests/build have been run and their results
    reported.
-   Provider dependencies and deployment setup are documented.
-   No fake or mock success is presented as a real production
    capability.

A phase is not complete merely because the page looks correct or the
code compiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 20. Final Implementation Principle

Build FixedItNow as a real, secure marketplace---not merely a
collection of attractive screens. Start with repository discovery and a
tested foundation, then implement each workflow from database to API to
UI. Keep the payment, identity verification, messaging, and AI trust
boundaries explicit. Use free tiers where practical, but treat their
limitations as deployment constraints rather than assumptions. Deliver
one verified phase at a time.
